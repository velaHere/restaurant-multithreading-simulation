# restaurant-multithreading-simulation
A Java-based restaurant simulation project focused on learning multithreading, concurrency concepts, and system design.

A learning-focused Java project that simulates the internal working of a restaurant using
**multithreading and concurrency concepts**.

The goal of this project is to understand:
- Thread coordination
- Shared resources
- Console-based interaction
- Clean system design in Java

---

## Project Goals:

- Simulate a real restaurant environment
- Customers placing orders
- Waiters handling requests
- Chefs preparing food
- A central restaurant controller managing everything
- Interactive console commands to control the simulation

---

## Concepts Explored:

- Java Threads
- Synchronization
- Wait / Notify
- Shared queues
- Thread lifecycle
- Console I/O coordination
- Basic system design patterns
